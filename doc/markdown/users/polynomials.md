# Polynomials {#polynomials}

In order to represent polynomials, we define the following hierarchy of classes:

- Variable: Represents a variable.
- Monomial: Represents a product of variables.
- Term: Represents a product of a constant factor and a Monomial.
- MultivariatePolynomial: Represents a polynomial in multiple variables with numeric coefficients.

- UnivariatePolynomial: Represents a polynomial in a single variable with either numeric or polynomial coefficients.

We will abbreviate these types as V, M, T, MP, UP.
