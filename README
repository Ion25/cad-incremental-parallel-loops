1. Dependencies
----------------------------------------------
This library has the following dependencies:

REQUIRED:
boost?

OPTIONAL:
cln
gmp

log4cplus *
googletest *
doxygen

Libraries marked with a asterix (*) are included in the resources directory.
More information on them is found in the README in that directory.

More information on the libraries is to be included
---------------------------------------------
2. Installation
---------------------------------------------
Start with:

$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

To compile dependencies (1) not found in the system AND (2) which are included in the resources:

$ make resources

To compile the arithmetic library:

$ make

To run some unittests:

$ make test

To compile examples:

$ make examples

To install:

$ make install

3. Including carl
---------------------------------------------

Notice that for other CMake-projects, carl registers itself in the CMake system, 
which simplifies finding carl to a simple find_package(carl), no matter if carl is installed or not.

--------------------------------------------
4. Supported platforms
--------------------------------------------

We have tested on the following platforms:

Arch Linux (Kernel 3.10) with GCC 4.8.2
Arch Linux (Kernel 3.10) with Clang 3.3
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with GCC 4.7.3

5. Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------

To be able to build and configure GTest under Mac OSX with clang and libc++ we adjust the CONFIGURE command for gtest in the file resources/CMakeLists.txt to:

CONFIGURE_COMMAND <SOURCE_DIR>/configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ "CXXFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11 -DGTEST_USE_OWN_TR1_TUPLE=1"
